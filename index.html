            <h2>Shaznay Walker</h2>
            <p>Hey there, my name is Shaznay Walker and I'm a third year Computer Science major. 
                Initially, I became interested in this field because of how rapidly technology is
                advancing and how platforms become integral parts of our daily lives. I decided to
                do this course with the aim of challenging my creativity whilst explore my critical 
                thinking in the process of creating well designed and interactive web based applications. 
                However, if I'm not learning new course material I'm typically exploring new music or particiating 
                in an outdoor sport/activity. I also dedicate time to learning about Japanese culture and watching 
                Thai dramas. An interesting fact about me is that despite being born on an island and residing in a 
                parish where rivers are almost inescapable, I can't swim. As such my goal for the year is to learn how to do so.</p>
